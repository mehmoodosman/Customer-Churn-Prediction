# Customer Churn Prediction with Machine Learning

This project involves building an end-to-end pipeline for a **Customer Churn Prediction** model, guiding you from data loading to model deployment.

## Project Overview

The goal is to predict customer churn by training multiple machine learning models and deploying the best-performing model for inference through a web app.

## Key Features

- **Data Loading and Preprocessing**: Load and clean the dataset to prepare it for model training.
- **Model Training**: Train 5 different machine learning models for churn prediction.
- **Hyperparameter Tuning**: Perform hyperparameter optimization to improve model performance.
- **Model Deployment**: Serve the best model through a web-based application for real-time predictions.
